==============================================================================
1. INTRO                                                         *GlimpseIntro*

Glimpse is a powerful indexing and query system, free for personal use.
	http://www.webglimpse.net

VimGlimpse is a basic Glimpse interface within Vim, based on a Vim Tip from
Jean-Rene David. 
	http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_glimpse_from_within_Vim

VimGlimpse retains normal Vim |:grep| functionality, and provides
additional Glimpse features outside of what |grepprg| can allow.  By
default, VimGlimpse only searches within your current working directory,
making it ideal for near instantaneous searches across a project.


==============================================================================
2. FUNCTIONALITY                                         *GlimpseFunctionality*

Glimpse installs two new global commands, *Glimpse* and *GlimpseIndex* .


SEARCHING ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you set the |g:glimpseKey|variable to something, you can search for
the word under the cursor with a keystroke.  Otherwise, just execute the
|:Glimpse| command.  Here are some examples (shamelessly stolen from the
glimpse man page):

    :Glimpse needle haystack.h$~

		Finds all needles in all haystack.h's files.

	:let g:glimpseFlags = "-iny -2"	~
	:Glimpse Anestesiology html ~

		Outputs all occurrences of  Anestesiology  with  two  errors  in
		files with html somewhere in their full name.

	:Glimpse windsurfing;Arizona mail;1993 ~

		Finds  all lines containing windsurfing and Arizona in all files
		having `mail' and '1993' somewhere in their full name.

Results are placed into the |quickfix| window.  Additionally, the 'q' key is
bound to the window so you can close it again quickly. 


INDEXING ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you set the |g:glimpseindexKey|variable to something, you can reindex
your current working directory with a keystroke.  Otherwise, just
you can just manually execute the |:GlimpseIndex| command.

Results from an index are placed into the location window.  You can view them
via |:lopen|.

If you are reindexing a large directory, this could take a few moments.
The defaults are to produce an incremental merge -- so it should be
fairly fast, but it's a good idea to ensure your indexes exist prior to
running this command.

If you've just installed glimpse, a great way to start playing with it
immediately is to let it index your entire home directory (from the shell):

	% glimpseindex -M 10 -B -o ~ ~

If you've deleted a lot of files, re-running this command will free up space
in your indexes.  I just run it nightly from cron.


==============================================================================
3. ADJUSTING-BEHAVIOR                                     *GlimpseVimrcExample*


Here's what my config looks like. >

	let g:glimpseFlags = "-winy1"
	let g:glimpseKey = "<Leader>g"
	let g:glimpseindexKey = "<Leader>G"


With these settings, I can find the full word under the cursor with
<Leader>g, in a case insensitive 1 character fuzzy match search.

With <Leader>G, I can quickly re-index my current working directory, so
changes to my files are reflected in search results.


==============================================================================
4. CONFIGURATION-OPTIONS                                       *GlimpseOptions*

Here are all of the available configuration options.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1                                                              *g:glimpseKey*

Setting this binding enables immediate searching for the |word| that is
currently under the cursor.  There is no default. >

	let g:glimpseKey = "<Leader>g"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2                                                         *g:glimpseindexKey*


Setting this enables reindexing with a keystroke, rather than running the
|GlimpseIndex| command manually.  There is no default. >

	let g:glimpseindexKey = "<Leader>G"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3                                                 *g:glimpseWindowResultSize*

Change the height of the results window.  The default is 15 lines. >

	let g:glimpseWindowResultSize = 15

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4                                                            *g:glimpseFlags*

Alter the command line flags used when executing glimpse.  If you alter
this, you should retain the '-n' flag, as the |quickfix| window relies
on that for line positioning.  The default is: >

	let g:glimpseFlags = "-iny"

See the glimpse man page for all available options.  (I find -w, -i, and
-# to be the most immediately useful.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5                                                       *g:glimpseindexFlags*

Alter the command line flags used when executing glimpseindex.
The default is: >

	let g:glimpseindexFlags = '-M 10 -B -o'

The '-f' flag with the current working directory is always appended to this
flag list.
